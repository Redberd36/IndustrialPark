**Industrial Park** is an archive viewer and editor for the following Heavy Iron Studios games:

* SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle For Bikini Bottom
* The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Game
* Scooby-Doo: Night of 100 Frights
* The Incredibles
* The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer
* Ratatouille (January 18th, 2006 Prototype)

for the following platforms:

* GameCube
* Xbox
* Playstation 2
* PC (Incredibles and ROTU only)

The tool (whose namesake is one of the levels in Battle For Bikini Bottom) can create, open, display, extract data from, edit and save the HIP/HOP archive files used in the games and contains multiple functions to aid on custom level creation; it's essentially a very fancy GUI for the [HipHopFile library](https://github.com/igorseabra4/HipHopTool). It was used by video game developer [Purple Lamp Studios](https://www.purplelamp.com/) during the development of [SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated](https://www.purplelamp.com/projects/spongebob-squarepants-rehydrated/) to aid on extracting data from the original game.

## Installation
> [!NOTE]
> Industrial Park is compatible with **Windows** (Windows 7 SP1 or later), and requires [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48) and Direct3D 11 support. It can be run on Linux using the Wine compatibility layer, [see here](https://www.heavyironmodding.org/wiki/Industrial_Park_(level_editor)#Instructions_for_Running_on_Linux_(Ubuntu)) for details, though not all features may work as expected.

1. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/igorseabra4/IndustrialPark/releases/latest) from releases.
2. Extract the .zip somewhere and launch IndustrialPark.exe.
3. Drag .HIP or .HOP files into the window to open them, or go to `Archive Editor > Open Level` to open a level.

## How to Use
Please see the project's [page on the Heavy Iron Modding wiki](https://heavyironmodding.org/wiki/Industrial_Park_(level_editor)) for additional information, including the links to the complete user guide/tutorials. It's highly recommended to read the [Essentials Series](https://heavyironmodding.org/wiki/Essentials_Series), which teaches the basics of how to create mods using Industrial Park.
